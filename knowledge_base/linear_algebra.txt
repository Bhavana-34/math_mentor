LINEAR ALGEBRA BASICS

1. MATRIX OPERATIONS
Addition: (A+B)_ij = A_ij + B_ij  (same dimensions required)
Scalar multiplication: (kA)_ij = k * A_ij
Matrix multiplication: (AB)_ij = sum_k A_ik * B_kj
NOTE: AB != BA in general (non-commutative)
Transpose: (A^T)_ij = A_ji
(AB)^T = B^T * A^T

2. DETERMINANTS
2x2: det[[a,b],[c,d]] = ad - bc
3x3: cofactor expansion along first row:
det(A) = a11*M11 - a12*M12 + a13*M13
where Mij = minor (det of submatrix after removing row i, col j)

Properties of determinants:
- det(AB) = det(A) * det(B)
- det(A^T) = det(A)
- det(kA) = k^n * det(A)  for n x n matrix
- If two rows are equal: det = 0
- Swapping two rows: det changes sign
- Adding multiple of one row to another: det unchanged

3. INVERSE MATRIX
A^{-1} exists if and only if det(A) != 0  (A is non-singular)
2x2 inverse: [[a,b],[c,d]]^{-1} = 1/(ad-bc) * [[d,-b],[-c,a]]
Property: A * A^{-1} = A^{-1} * A = I (identity matrix)
(AB)^{-1} = B^{-1} * A^{-1}

4. SYSTEM OF LINEAR EQUATIONS Ax = b
Unique solution: det(A) != 0  -> x = A^{-1} * b
Cramer's rule: x_i = det(A_i) / det(A)
  where A_i = A with column i replaced by b
No unique solution: det(A) = 0

Row reduction (Gaussian elimination):
- Write augmented matrix [A|b]
- Use row operations to reach row echelon form
- Back-substitute to find solution

5. EIGENVALUES AND EIGENVECTORS
Definition: Av = lambda*v  where v != 0
Characteristic equation: det(A - lambda*I) = 0
For 2x2: lambda^2 - trace(A)*lambda + det(A) = 0

Properties:
- trace(A) = sum of diagonal entries = sum of eigenvalues
- det(A) = product of eigenvalues
- Eigenvectors for different eigenvalues are linearly independent

To find eigenvector for eigenvalue lambda:
Solve (A - lambda*I)v = 0

6. RANK AND NULLITY
Rank = number of linearly independent rows (or columns)
Nullity = number of free variables in Ax = 0
Rank-Nullity theorem: rank(A) + nullity(A) = number of columns
System Ax = b is consistent iff rank(A) = rank([A|b])

COMMON MISTAKES IN LINEAR ALGEBRA
- Matrix multiplication is NOT commutative
- Inverse only exists for square non-singular matrices
- Scaling a row multiplies determinant by that scalar
- Eigenvectors are not unique (any scalar multiple works)
- Not verifying det != 0 before finding inverse
