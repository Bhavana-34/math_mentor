PROBABILITY FORMULAS AND CONCEPTS

1. BASIC PROBABILITY
P(A) = favorable outcomes / total outcomes
0 <= P(A) <= 1
P(A') = 1 - P(A)  [complement rule]

2. ADDITION RULE
P(A union B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A intersection B)
For mutually exclusive events: P(A union B) = P(A) + P(B)

3. MULTIPLICATION RULE
P(A intersection B) = P(A) * P(B|A) = P(B) * P(A|B)
For independent events: P(A intersection B) = P(A) * P(B)

4. CONDITIONAL PROBABILITY
P(A|B) = P(A intersection B) / P(B),  where P(B) != 0

5. BAYES THEOREM
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
P(B) = P(B|A)*P(A) + P(B|A')*P(A')  [total probability]

6. COMBINATORICS
Permutation (order matters): P(n,r) = n! / (n-r)!
Combination (order doesn't matter): C(n,r) = n! / (r! * (n-r)!)
With repetition: n^r arrangements

7. BINOMIAL DISTRIBUTION
P(X=k) = C(n,k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)
Mean = np
Variance = np(1-p)
Standard deviation = sqrt(np(1-p))

8. GEOMETRIC DISTRIBUTION
P(X=k) = (1-p)^(k-1) * p   [first success on kth trial]
Mean = 1/p

9. EXPECTED VALUE AND VARIANCE
E(X) = sum of x * P(X=x)
E(aX + b) = aE(X) + b
Var(X) = E(X^2) - [E(X)]^2
Var(aX + b) = a^2 * Var(X)

SOLUTION TEMPLATES FOR PROBABILITY

Template A - Counting Problems:
1. Identify total sample space size
2. Count favorable outcomes systematically
3. Apply combinations or permutations
4. Compute ratio = favorable / total

Template B - Conditional Probability:
1. Identify the given condition
2. Reduce sample space to satisfy condition
3. Count favorable outcomes in reduced space
4. Compute P = favorable / reduced total

Template C - Bayes Problems:
1. List all hypotheses H1, H2, ...
2. Find prior probabilities P(Hi)
3. Find likelihoods P(E|Hi)
4. Apply Bayes: P(Hi|E) = P(E|Hi)*P(Hi) / sum[P(E|Hj)*P(Hj)]

COMMON MISTAKES IN PROBABILITY
- Confusing permutation with combination
- Not checking independence before multiplying
- Forgetting complement rule shortcut
- Double counting in union problems
- Forgetting to reduce sample space in conditional problems
