JEE MATH SOLUTION STRATEGIES AND TEMPLATES

GENERAL PROBLEM-SOLVING FRAMEWORK
1. Read carefully - identify what is GIVEN and what is ASKED
2. Identify the topic/domain (algebra, calculus, probability, etc.)
3. Recall relevant formulas for that topic
4. Plan solution steps BEFORE computing
5. Execute calculations step by step showing all work
6. VERIFY the answer (domain, sign, units, reasonableness)

ALGEBRA TEMPLATES

Template A: Quadratic Problems
Given: equation or conditions on roots
Step 1: Write as ax^2 + bx + c = 0
Step 2: Compute D = b^2 - 4ac, check nature of roots
Step 3: Use Vieta's if sum/product of roots needed
Step 4: Use quadratic formula for exact roots

Template B: Sequence and Series
Given: AP or GP sequence
Step 1: Identify type - check constant differences (AP) or ratios (GP)
Step 2: Extract first term and common difference/ratio
Step 3: Apply nth term or sum formula

Template C: Inequalities
Step 1: Move everything to one side
Step 2: Find critical points (zeros of numerator and denominator)
Step 3: Test intervals using sign chart
Step 4: State solution with correct brackets

PROBABILITY TEMPLATES

Template A: Basic Counting
Step 1: Define sample space clearly and count total outcomes
Step 2: List favorable outcomes systematically (use combinations)
Step 3: P = favorable / total
Step 4: Check answer is between 0 and 1

Template B: Conditional Probability
Step 1: Identify the conditioning event
Step 2: Reduce sample space to that event
Step 3: Count favorable within reduced space
Step 4: Compute ratio

Template C: Bayes Theorem
Step 1: Identify all mutually exclusive hypotheses
Step 2: Write prior probabilities P(Hi)
Step 3: Write likelihoods P(Evidence | Hi) for each
Step 4: Apply Bayes formula
Step 5: Verify posteriors sum to 1

CALCULUS TEMPLATES

Template A: Limit Evaluation
Step 1: Try direct substitution first
Step 2: If 0/0: try factoring, rationalizing, or standard limits
Step 3: If still stuck: apply L'Hopital's rule
Step 4: Check if one-sided limits differ

Template B: Optimization
Step 1: Define variables and objective function
Step 2: Express in one variable using constraint
Step 3: Differentiate, set f'(x) = 0
Step 4: Second derivative test for max/min
Step 5: Check boundary conditions
Step 6: State answer in context of problem

Template C: Integration
Step 1: Identify technique (direct, substitution, by parts)
Step 2: For substitution: choose u, find du
Step 3: Transform integral entirely in u
Step 4: Integrate and back-substitute
Step 5: For definite integral: apply limits after

LINEAR ALGEBRA TEMPLATES

Template A: Solving System Ax = b
Step 1: Write augmented matrix [A|b]
Step 2: Row reduce to echelon form
Step 3: Check consistency (rank conditions)
Step 4: Back-substitute for solution

Template B: Finding Eigenvalues/Eigenvectors
Step 1: Set up det(A - lambda*I) = 0
Step 2: Expand and solve characteristic polynomial
Step 3: For each lambda, solve (A - lambda*I)v = 0
Step 4: Express eigenvector as free parameter

VERIFICATION CHECKLIST
After solving, always verify:
[ ] Probability: 0 <= P <= 1
[ ] Log: argument is positive
[ ] Square root: result is non-negative
[ ] Division: denominator != 0
[ ] Optimization: it's truly a max/min (second derivative test)
[ ] Quadratic: check roots satisfy original equation
[ ] Matrix inverse: det != 0

COMMON JEE TRICK QUESTION PATTERNS
1. Probability > 1 trap: always verify final P is valid
2. Determinant = 0 trap: check before using Cramer's rule
3. Log domain trap: argument must be strictly positive
4. Square root trap: sqrt(x^2) = |x|, not just x
5. Division by variable: consider case when variable = 0
6. Infinite GP: valid only when |r| < 1
7. AP/GP confusion: always verify constant difference vs ratio
